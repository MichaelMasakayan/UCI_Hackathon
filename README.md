## What it does

The "liked properties" section allows you to RSVP for open houses and contact real estate agents. It gives home buyers a better idea of what estates they're looking for. Real estate agents are able to easily update information on the site in case of any changes. In case of a misclick, users can also review their disliked properties.

## Technologies used:

We created OpenHouse using the React JS framework. We built unique components, such as the open house profile cards and swiping feature, and integrated them into the website pages. We used bootstrap four and CSS to stylized components and create a theme for our project. We utilized data structures like maps to store our information effectively.
